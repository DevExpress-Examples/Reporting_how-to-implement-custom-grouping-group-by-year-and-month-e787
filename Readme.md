# How to implement custom grouping (group by Year and Month)


<p>This example demonstrates how to implement custom grouping in a report.</p><p>For this example to work correctly, you should first bind a report to the <strong>Orders</strong> table of the <strong>Northwind Traders</strong> demo database, which is shipped with XtraReports, add bound controls to the report's detail band, then add two group header bands and add the <strong>OrderDate</strong> data field to the GroupFields collections of these two group headers. Also, to show month name and year values, these bands should contain label controls -<strong>lbMonthName</strong> and <strong>lbYear</strong>.</p><p>See also:<br />
